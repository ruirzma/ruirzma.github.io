<!-- Rui’s primary research focuses on the joint simulation and modeling of building energy consumption, urban microclimate dynamics, and energy management at the city scale. Rui’s interests also involve urban morphology, building reconstruction, semantic city 3D models, and digital twins. -->

I am an urban researcher with a PhD from the City University of Hong Kong. My work is driven by a passion for enhancing urban sustainability and efficiency through innovative technology and data-driven solutions. Key areas of my work include:
<!-- <big>**Research Focus**</big> -->

* **Urban Building Energy Modeling**: Developing scalable   models to simulate energy dynamics at the city scale.
* **GeoAI**: Leveraging spatial analysis and AI modeling to understand and improve urban systems.
* **3D Building Reconstruction**: Enhancing the precision of urban models through detailed 3D reconstructions.
* **Urban Microclimate Analysis**: Investigating how urban design influences local climates and proposing solutions to mitigate adverse effects.
