<!-- Rui’s primary research focuses on the joint simulation and modeling of building energy consumption, urban microclimate dynamics, and energy management at the city scale. Rui’s interests also involve urban morphology, building reconstruction, semantic city 3D models, and digital twins. -->

<big>**Welcome to my homepage**</big>

**About Me**
I am an urban researcher with a PhD from the City University of Hong Kong. My work is driven by a passion for enhancing urban sustainability and efficiency through innovative technology and data-driven solutions.

**Research Focus**
* <u>Urban Building Energy Modeling</u>: Developing scalable   models to simulate energy dynamics at the city scale.
* <u>Geospatial Data Science</u>: Leveraging spatial analysis to understand and improve urban systems.
* <u>3D Building Reconstruction</u>: Enhancing the precision of urban models through detailed 3D reconstructions.
* <u>Urban Microclimate Analysis</u>: Investigating how urban design influences local climates and proposing solutions to mitigate adverse effects.

**Get in Touch**
Feel free to connect with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rui-ma-820361163) profile or reach out directly via [email](rui.rz.ma@gmail.com). I am open to collaborative opportunities and discussions about potential projects that align with my research interests.
